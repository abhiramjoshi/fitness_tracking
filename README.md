# fitness_tracker

The fitness tracker is a command line tool that connects to a MongoDB backend, currently this is a private repo as there are a number of security issues wrt to connecting to the MongoDB that need to be resolved, though it is not necessary immediately. 

Currently the tracker is able to keep track of macro nutrients for users as well as retrieve the meals associated with a user and also create food meals etc. Future functionality can include workout tracking and further data visualization and other tools are also required.
